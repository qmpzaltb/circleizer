circleizer
==========

Circleizes images into many circles using state-of-the-art blazingly-slow algorithms.

~~The color of circleized circles is currently predefined due to the lack of an algorithm to pick out points of high density in a three-dimensional scatter-plot.~~

You know what? Disregard that struck-out statement. We now have the technology necessary to TAKE OUT these points of high density. Circelization capabilities have increased tremendously. Remember your old black and white television? Neither do we. This is the future of circleization. No longer do you have to do the menial task of ISOLATING THE PUREST COLOR of circles. We can do that for you.
